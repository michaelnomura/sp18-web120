<p>Finding a app that adds a shopping cart to your site can be a confusing task. There are numerous options available and everyone seem to have different opinions on what is best. It seems apparent that you must analyze your business to find the right fit. Jeremy Wong from websitebuilderexpert.com says “It’s confusing as heck” about choosing a shopping cart. I think it is important to look closely at your business as well as think about the needs of your customer.</p>
<p>The first thing to think about is weather it makes sense to use a existing store as a proxy. Amazon, Ebay, Etsy all allow you to sell your product without need if your own web presence. If you are not selling a high volume of products does it make sense to maintain a shopping cart? There are numerous fees involved with having a shopping cart on your site. According to Melanie Pinola of Lifehacker “Authorize.net is one of the most popular (payment) gateways...has a set up fee of around $100, a monthly fee of $20, and transaction fees of about $0.10”</p>
<p>After working in retail for many years I have found that shipping is a crucial part of any store so matter what the size. Once someone buys something online they will be wanting to know when and how it will get to them. Being able to track their package will ressaure the customer that their package will arrive and also it will make your business look more professional in the process. According to the Wikipedia’s “Comparison of shopping cart software” the Bigcommerce apps has the most options with different shipping companies, so if you are shipping to many different locals it could be very useful.

<p>It seems apparent to me that it is important to start small when it comes to a shopping cart. There is no reason to pay a bunch of fees hoping you get sales. Try to find the best solution that gives the customer a positive experience.</p>
