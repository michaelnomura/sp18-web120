     <p>The is a huge number of galleries available with an extensive set of feature available with each one. It really depends on how many images you need to display and how often you intend to change them. Most are made using jQuery often utilizing the slider 1stwebdesigner.com states  “usually the best galleries are created in jQuery, we’ve mainly focussed on jQuery type sliders.” Some even offer to host your images on their site existing as an all in one solution at the cost of some amount of control.
</p>
     <p>How you want the images to be displayed could be a factor after you have narrowed it down. If you are a photographer then it would make sense to have a page the you could control using your keyboard. This would allow the user view the images in a more leisurely way, allow them to relax while view the photos. Sven Lennartz from Smashingmagazine.com says“the presentation itself can make images more valuable and simplify the browsing through hundreds of slides.”
</p>
     <p>The price a bunch ranging from $0 for Bootstrap Gallery to $150 for WOW Slider. The more expensive options do not require coding which may take the cost down allow you as the customer more freedom in curating the images. If you want the images to change a lot then it might be the best option to allow yourself the freedom of being able to update the site by yourself. WOW Slider advertises  “The drag-n-drop maker generates the slider automatically with the export as HTML page or Joomla/Wordpress plugin.”
</p>
     <p>I think it is best to look ak at the frequency of you updates first then look at what best fits your budget.If photos are your business I would want to spend a little more for a great presentation, since that plays a large part of your business. On the other hand if you are selling used car parts it may not matter as much.
