<p>The question is which type of app I should build a native or a responsive. Mobile phones have become the norm, more than half of the people walking down the street are staring at their phones. Many businesses’ websites will rarely be viewed through a monitor. So which type is best for you business? The answer varies depending on the type of business you have.
</p>
<p>There are many factors one must take into account, for starters size of your team. If you have a small team it would be tough to make a native app. Native apps require having at least an Android version and a Apple version. With a responsive app you would only have to deal with one app since all devices have their own web browser. A quote from Lubo Smid at Forbes “Make one change, and it can be instantly seen on all platforms.” </p>
<p>Another big factor is the type of data being presented. If you are displaying complex media through a responsive app the results can be slow, since you are viewing the app through the web browser.  Emmanuel Urias from invidgroup.com says about native “native apps are able to use more resources and features of the device which means that they run faster and smoother..”</p>
<p>One interesting variable I found is marketing of your app. With a responsive app people can search and find it through a search engine. This can be a lot harder with a native app that is relegated to the app store which can be difficult to navigate especially with Android. Sawyer Bateman from UXmagazine says, “to appear as though the app is actually a part of the phone, and to make it synonymous with the phone, as is a great app's intent, this is still impossible with responsive design.”
</p>
<p>After reading about the subject I think it really depends of what you are doing with the app. There is never one solution to any problem and I think apps are the same, a problem that has many solutions. Like choosing the right golf club for the lie. Is important to find the right vehicle for you business.</p>
